#+TITLE: 2048 game in ClojureScript
#+DATE: <2021-03-14 Sun>

An attempt to build 2048 game in ClojureScript.

* Bootstrapping

We're going to need these things to start coding:
- ClojureScript
- Tailwind
- CIDER for development

** First attempt that didn't work

Use [[https://github.com/pavel-popov/create-reagent-app][create-reagent-app]] template like this:


#+begin_src sh :result verbatim
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {seancorfield/clj-new {:mvn/version "1.1.264"}}}' \
  -X clj-new/create \
  :template '"https://github.com/pavel-popov/create-reagent-app@v0.0.1"' \
  :name pvlpp/game2048
#+end_src

Note, make sure you don't have URL overwrite in your git configuration
(=~/.gitconfig=, like I did, so needed to comment out this block:

#+begin_example ini
[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
   insteadOf = https://github.com/
#+end_example

** Second attempt using repository template

I created a new repo from a template [[https://github.com/pavel-popov/shadow-cljs-template][shadow-cljs-template]] and adjusted
packages to latest versions.

To start an app for the first time so it would download all packages
and build it run:

#+begin_src sh

#+end_src

* Building CSS with Tailwind

Production build with all unused styles removed:
#+begin_src sh
NODE_ENV=production npm run tw
#+end_src
